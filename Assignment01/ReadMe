7)What Does Object Mean?
Ans :Objects are the fundamental entities stored in Amazon S3. Objects consist of object data and metadata. The data portion is opaque to Amazon S3. 
The metadata is a set of name-value pairs that describe the object. These include some default metadata, such as the date last modified, and standard HTTP metadata, 
such as Content-Type. You can also specify custom metadata at the time the object is stored. 
An object is uniquely identified within a bucket by a key (name) and a version ID. For more information, see Keys and Versioning.
8)What does Key Mean?

A key is the unique identifier for an object within a bucket. Every object in a bucket has exactly one key. Because the combination of a bucket, key, 
and version ID uniquely identify each object, Amazon S3 can be thought of as a basic data map between "bucket + key + version" and the object itself. 
Every object in Amazon S3 can be uniquely addressed through the combination of the web service endpoint, bucket name, key, and optionally, a version. 
For example, in the URL http://doc.s3.amazonaws.com/2006-0301/AmazonS3.wsdl, "doc" is the name of the bucket and "2006-03-01/AmazonS3.wsdl" is the key.
